### Godot 2D Game Design Learning Project

Godot 2D Game Design Learning Project - This repository documents my journey as I follow a tutorial to learn about creating 2D games using the Godot game engine.
The tutorial I'm following focuses on the essentials of game design and development using Godot 4.

## Technical Skills

I am currently following a tutorial series that provides a comprehensive introduction to 2D game design with Godot. The tutorial covers key topics that are crucial for creating engaging 2D games:

- **Character Movement:** I am learning how to handle character movement within the game world using Godot's input handling system.
- **Animations:** The tutorial is guiding me through the process of creating animations for game characters using the AnimationPlayer node.
- **Tilemap Setup:** I am getting experience with setting up tilemaps to design the game environment and levels.
- **Physics Collisions:** The tutorial is helping me understand how to implement basic physics collisions to create interaction between the player character and the game world.
- **Smooth Camera:** I am learning how to implement a smooth camera system that follows the player character, enhancing the sidescrolling gameplay experience.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites:** To get started with this learning project, I have ensured that I have Godot 4.1.1 installed on my system. I downloaded it from the official Godot website: [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/).

2. **Repository:** I have created all the files and work in the godot engine, and I have made this repository for work across multiple workstations,
as well as have a clear space for project development.
